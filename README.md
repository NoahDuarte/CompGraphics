Approaching software design:
Understand the requirements: 
Start by gaining a clear understanding of the problem you're trying to solve and the needs of the users. Define the goals and objectives of the software. Research and gather information. Start by exploring existing solutions, technologies, and best practices related to your project. This research phase will help you make informed design decisions. Defining the architecture to create a high-level design that outlines the overall structure and components of the software. This step involves breaking down the system into smaller modules and defining their relationships. Next you will need to refine the design. Incorporate feedback and iterate on your design. Consider usability, scalability, performance, and maintainability aspects while refining the software architecture and user interface. Finally you will implement and test your design. Begin implementing the software based on your design. Perform thorough testing to ensure functionality, identify and fix any issues, and validate that the software meets the requirements.

Design skills from my work on this project:
Working on this project has helped me enhance various design skills, such as: User-centered design: Prioritizing the needs and preferences of the users to create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. Design thinking: Applying a problem-solving approach that involves empathy, ideation, prototyping, and testing to arrive at innovative solutions. Visual design: Improving the aesthetic appeal and usability of the software through effective visual elements, such as layout, color, typography, and textures. Interaction design: Creating engaging and seamless interactions between the user and the software, focusing on usability and accessibility.

My design process followed for the project:
The specific design process may vary depending on the project, however for this project, the process involved the following steps:
1 .Understanding project requirements and objectives.
3. Defining the software architecture and components.
4. Creating prototypes and mockups of the verticeies needed to visualize the design.
5. Iterating and refining the design.
6. Implementing the design and repeatedly testing the software for functionality.
7. Making necessary adjustments based on testing results.

Approaching program development:
Define the problem: Clearly understand the problem that is to be solved through the software. Plan and design: Break down the problem into smaller tasks, plan the development process, and design the software architecture. Implement: Write the code according to the design, following best practices and coding standards. Test and debug: Thoroughly test the software, identify and fix any issues or bugs, and ensure it meets the requirements. Iterate and improve: Make improvements, and iterate on the software based on user needs and changing requirements.

New development strategies used in the 3D scene:
While working on the 3D scene, some development strategies that I have employed include: Object-oriented programming: Utilizing object-oriented principles to organize and structure the codebase, making it modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. Version control: Using a version control system to manage code changes, collaborate with others, and track the project's progress
